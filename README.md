### About this repository

This is a general working folder for projects involving NBA data and statistics.

Pardon the disorganization, a stretch goal is to place finalized notebooks, and projects into separate repositories.

# nba-raptor

This folder contains data behind the story [Introducing RAPTOR, Our New Metric For The Modern NBA](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/introducing-raptor-our-new-metric-for-the-modern-nba)

`modern_RAPTOR_by_player.csv` contains the RAPTOR data for every player broken out by season since 2014, when NBA player-tracking data first became available.

`modern_RAPTOR_by_team.csv` contains RAPTOR data for every player broken out by team, season, and season_type since 2014, when NBA player-tracking data first became available.

These "modern" data files contain the boxscore and on/off plus-minus components of RAPTOR, which are then combined into a total RAPTOR rating.


`historical_RAPTOR_by_player.csv` contains the RAPTOR data for every player broken out by season since the 1976 ABA-NBA merger.


`historical_RAPTOR_by_team.csv` contains RAPTOR data for every player broken out by team, season, and season_type since the 1976 ABA-NBA merger.

These "historical" data files use full player-tracking RAPTOR for seasons since 2014, a version of RAPTOR that mixes boxscore value estimates with single-year regularized plus-minus data for seasons from 2001 to 2013, and a version of RAPTOR that only uses a boxscore estimate of value for the seasons from 1977 through 2000. In each era, the RAPTOR version with the highest level of detail is the version used.
